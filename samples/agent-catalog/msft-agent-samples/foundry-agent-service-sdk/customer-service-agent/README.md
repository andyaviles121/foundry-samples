# üí¨ Customer Support Agent

This is a code sample for a multi-phase workflow built with Azure AI Agent Service, designed to assist customers with secure authentication and billing inquiries. It uses a state-based orchestration to verify customer identity and retrieve billing information, while supporting human-in-the-loop escalation.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Starter templates, instructions, code samples and resources in this msft-agent-samples file (‚Äúsamples‚Äù) are designed to assist in accelerating development of agents for specific scenarios. It is important that you review all provided resources and carefully test Agent behavior in the context of your use case: ([Learn More](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/agents/transparency-note?context=%2Fazure%2Fai-services%2Fagents%2Fcontext%2Fcontext)). 

Certain Agent offerings may be subject to legal and regulatory requirements, may require licenses, or may not be suitable for all industries, scenarios, or use cases.‚ÄØBy using any sample, you are acknowledging that Agents or other output created using that sample are solely your responsibility, and that you will comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and relevant safety standards, terms of service, and codes of conduct.

## üíº Use Cases

- **Customer Authentication**: Verify users through ID or account number prior to handling sensitive queries.
- **Billing Inquiry Support**: Retrieve and explain billing details for a verified account.
- **Agent Escalation Readiness**: Stream output to users and fallback to human-in-loop if input or context is missing.
- **Workflow Handoff**: Easily expandable to handle follow-ups like payment assistance, usage summaries, or complaint handling.

### VSCode extension (early access) setup

WARNING: This extension is an experimental version and is not recommended for us in production environments. The official version of the Azure AI Foundry VS Code Extension will be supporting multi-agent workflows in the near future.

1. In shell, run the 'Easy Setup' script below to deploy all the agents and workflows
   
```
set -eu
export CONNECTION_STRING= "<host>;<subscription_id>;<resource_group>;<project_name>"

FILE_PATH="./core/HumanEscalationAgent.agent"  ./src/scripts/deploy.sh
FILE_PATH="./core/RoutingAgent.agent"  ./src/scripts/deploy.sh
FILE_PATH="./core/SelfServiceAgent.agent"  ./src/scripts/deploy.sh
FILE_PATH="./core/TicketCreationAgent.agent"  ./src/scripts/deploy.sh
FILE_PATH="./core/TicketResolutionAgent.agent"  ./src/scripts/deploy.sh
FILE_PATH="./core/WindowsSupport.agent"  ./src/scripts/deploy.sh
FILE_PATH="./workflows/CustomerSupport.fdl"  ./src/scripts/deploy.sh

```

2. Open the 'samples' directory in VS Code
3. Open the customer_support.fdl file in (add path here). You will see the workflows visualizer appear.
